Andreas D. Meid is a post-doctoral researcher in the Dept. of Clinical Pharmacology & Pharmacoepidemiology at Heidelberg University Hospital. Research interests include the use of large (pharmacoepidemiologic) databases to determine individualized treatment recommendations using predictive modeling for personalized medicine. He collaborates with clinicians and leading methodologists and applies cutting-edge methods of parametric statistical modeling, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning. In addition to leading the Pharmacoepidemiology group, he is also deeply involved in analyses of quantitative Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics. In doing so, he aims to quantify benefits and risks of drugs in regular and special populations (e.g., older or pediatric patients).
