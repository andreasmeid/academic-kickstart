abstract: Real-world effectiveness of a new treatment is relevant information for patients, healthcare professionals and payers, especially when patients encountered in routine clinical care differ significantly from those recruited in the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that led to approval. However, obtaining effect estimates can be challenging when a new drug has only recently been marketed and real-world data (RWD) are not yet available. For new breast cancer (BC) therapies, we illustrate how RCT inferences can be transported to a target population and how a synthetic population can be generated to mimic a target population for which no RWD is yet available. In our framework, we defined the data-generating process for the RCT population and the real-world (target) population with confounders, effect-modulating covariates and survival times as outcomes. First, we conducted generalisability and transportability analyses to transport the RCT results to the simulated target population, applying the inverse probability of sampling weighting and outcome model-based estimator approach. We then used Synthea to generate a synthetic target population based on German BC survival rates and combined both approaches into a coherent strategy. Effect estimates (HRs with 95% CIs) transported from the RCT to our defined target population closely matched the expected real-world effect (RCT 0.68 (0.65; 0.71); real-world 0.75 (0.71; 0.79); transported from RCT 0.76 (0.71; 0.81)). BC survival rates were very similar between observed and synthetic data (prediction error in absolute survival rates: 1.62%). Combining generalisability and transportability analyses with synthetic data may inform decision-making in situations where RWD are not (yet) available.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Applying generalisability and transportability analyses to realistic synthetic data in situations where no real-world data (RWD) are available (eg, because a drug has only recently been marketed) can help to inform which patient can benefit from the new drug. Generalisability and transportability analyses analyses should be considered as a statistical technique to provide valuable insights for clinical decision-making and to guide future trials, and under no circumstances as a replacement for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a more diverse trial population. It will be interesting to see how the proposed approach works in practice in the future, whether in the chosen example of a new antibody-drug conjugate for breast cancer treatment or in other conceivable situations where knowing the patient benefit in routine care is particularly important.
