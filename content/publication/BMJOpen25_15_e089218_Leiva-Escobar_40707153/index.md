# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Applying generalisability and transportability analyses to realistic synthetic data in situations where no real-world data (RWD) are available (eg, because a drug has only recently been marketed) can help to inform which patient can benefit from the new drug. Generalisability and transportability analyses analyses should be considered as a statistical technique to provide valuable insights for clinical decision-making and to guide future trials, and under no circumstances as a replacement for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a more diverse trial population. It will be interesting to see how the proposed approach works in practice in the future, whether in the chosen example of a new antibody-drug conjugate for breast cancer treatment or in other conceivable situations where knowing the patient benefit in routine care is particularly important.
