abstract: When healthcare professionals have the choice between several drug treatments for their patients, they often experience considerable decision uncertainty because many decisions simply have no single "best" choice. The challenges are manifold and include that guideline recommendations focus on randomized controlled trials whose populations do not necessarily correspond to specific patients in everyday treatment. Further reasons may be insufficient evidence on outcomes, lack of direct comparison of distinct options, and the need to individually balance benefits and risks. All these situations will occur in routine care, its outcomes will be mirrored in routine data, and could thus be used to guide decisions. We propose a concept to facilitate decision-making by exploiting this wealth of information. Our working example for illustration assumes that the response to a particular (drug) treatment can substantially differ between individual patients depending on their characteristics (heterogeneous treatment effects, HTE), and that decisions will be more precise if they are based on real-world evidence of HTE considering this information. However, such methods must account for confounding by indication and effect measure modification, eg, by adequately using machine learning methods or parametric regressions to estimate individual responses to pharmacological treatments. The better a model assesses the underlying HTE, the more accurate are predicted probabilities of treatment response. After probabilities for treatment-related benefit and harm have been calculated, decision rules can be applied and patient preferences can be considered to provide individual recommendations. Emulated trials in observational data are a straightforward technique to predict the effects of such decision rules when applied in routine care. Prediction-based decision rules from routine data have the potential to efficiently supplement clinical guidelines and support healthcare professionals in creating personalized treatment plans using decision support tools.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Our methodological perspective assumes that individual patients respond differently to pharmacological treatments and that thorough (quantitative) knowledge of effect modifiers will help predicting individual responses to medicines (personalized medicine). Validated decision support could efficiently complement clinical guidelines and support the healthcare professional when interpreting complex patient data, weighing the benefit and risks of multiple treatment options, and trying to incorporate patient preferences to finally design a personalized treatment plan. The ultimate goal would be to select the most efficacious therapies (to avoid nonresponse), avert adverse drug events (to avoid harm), and thus reduce costs and improve relevant endpoints (i.e., survival or quality of life) for patients and other stakeholders.
