abstract: A recent population pharmacokinetic model describes how the pharmacokinetic profile of dolutegravir is changed upon (simultaneous) adminstration of rifabutin (after a two-week induction phase). While this model fits the observed data well, the population pharmacokinetic approach cannot provide direct mechanistic explanations for the interaction per se. We aimed to illuminate potential mechanisms and to evaluate them via a physiology-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and experimental in vitro data. Within a PBPK modeling platform, we implemented a gastrointestinal efflux process for clearance by P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Mimicking the expected effect of rifabutin, we pragmatically introduced correction factors for both gastrointestinal efflux and enhanced hepatic metabolism. This exploratory approach yielded dolutegravir profiles that could be verified against original data on the interaction between rifabutin and dolutegravir. To pursue the assumption of Pgp inhibition further, we assessed the human Pgp-inhibitory effect of rifabutin and rifampicin via an established in vitro system. Our assay data showed that rifabutin can
strongly (estimated EC50 18.7 μM) inhibit cellular efflux. We conclude that rifabutin can enhance absorption (indicated by higher Cmax) of Pgp substrate victim drugs by inhibiting intestinal Pgp. This might be most important during the initial phase of combination therapy. Beyond, rifabutin in fact is an inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters after repetitive administration, potentially leading to lowered victim drug exposure. However, Pgp inhibition – albeit only temporary with simultaneous exposure – can still overlap (or even exceed) with induction effects.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We conclude the following: First, rifabutin can enhance absorption (indicated by higher Cmax) of P-gp substrate victim drugs by inhibiting intestinal P-gp. This might be most important during the initial phase of combination therapy. Second, rifabutin is in fact an inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters after repetitive administration, potentially leading to lowered victim drug exposure. However, P-gp inhibition can still overlap with (or even exceed) induction effects, especially when the victim drug and rifabutin (perpetrator) are administered simultaneously, leading to high intestinal rifabutin inhibitory drug concentrations. In general, we would also like to emphasize how important it is to complement empirical results with mechanistic analyses. In this regard, the important work of Kawuma and co-workers was a very valuable contribution.
